# IWTomics4Galaxy

Implementation of the [Interval-Wise Testing (IWT) for omics data](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IWTomics.html) tool for Galaxy. This inferential procedure tests for differences in "Omics" data between two groups of genomic regions (or between a group of genomic regions and a reference center of symmetry), and does not require fixing location and scale at the outset.

## Tool dependencies
- R 3.3.1
- [bioconductor-iwtomics](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-iwtomics) 1.0.0 BioConda package

# IWTomics4Galaxy

Implementation of the [Interval-Wise Testing (IWT) for omics data](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IWTomics.html) tool for Galaxy. This inferential procedure tests for differences in "Omics" data between two groups of genomic regions, and does not require fixing location and scale at the outset.

## Tool dependencies
- R 3.3.1
- [bioconductor-iwtomics 1.0.0](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-iwtomics) BioConda package

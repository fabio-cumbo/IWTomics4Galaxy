This example contains two region datasets "ETn fixed", "Control" and one feature "Recombination hotspots content".
In particular, the region dataset "ETn fixed" contains 1296 genomic regions of 64 kb surrounding
fixed ETns elements (32-kb flanking sequences upstream and 32-kb flanking sequences downstream
of each element). The region dataset "Control" contains 1142 regions of 64 kb without elements,
used as control in the test. The regions are aligned around their center (i.e. around the ETn integration
sites).
Recombination hotspots measurements are associated to each "ETn fixed" and "Control" region. In
particular, this feature is measured in 1-kb windows, so that each region is associated to a recombination
hotspots curve made of 64 values. The measurement used is the feature content, i.e. the
fraction of the 1-kb window that is covered by recombination hotspots
